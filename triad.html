          <h1>Triad Home Styles &amp; Wi-Fi Performance</h1>
          <p>
            Homes in the Triad come in all shapes and materials – brick ranches, two-story colonials, modern open-concept builds, and historic plaster-walled homes.
            Each behaves differently when it comes to Wi-Fi. Here’s how your home’s style might be affecting your signal – and what we usually do about it.

        <h2>Brick Ranch Homes</h2>
        <p>
          Single-story brick ranches are everywhere around Davie County. They’re great to live in, but brick and long, stretched-out layouts can be rough on Wi-Fi.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Brick and masonry soak up Wi-Fi. A router at one end of a long ranch often leaves the far bedrooms starving.</li>
          <li><strong>Typical Fix:</strong> Move the main router toward the center of the home and add a second access point or wired mesh node toward the far end.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Two-Story Homes</h2>
        <p>
          In two-story homes, especially when the router lives on the first floor in a corner, upstairs rooms can suffer – the signal has to punch through floors, insulation, and sometimes ductwork.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Vertical separation and dense floor/ceiling materials make upstairs coverage spotty.</li>
          <li><strong>Typical Fix:</strong> At least one access point per floor, ideally wired. We often mount a ceiling AP upstairs roughly above the main router/AP downstairs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Older / Historic Homes</h2>
        <p>
          Older homes with plaster walls (especially with metal lath) or stone interior walls are some of the toughest environments for Wi-Fi.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Plaster + metal lath and thick stone can almost block Wi-Fi entirely between rooms.</li>
          <li><strong>Typical Fix:</strong> Multiple wired access points. We carefully run cable to key locations and install low-profile APs so the network works without ruining the character of the home.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section section-tight">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Modern Open-Concept Homes</h2>
        <p>
          Newer open-concept builds often look easy for Wi-Fi – fewer walls – but huge spaces, tall ceilings, and energy-efficient windows can still cause problems.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Long distances to lofts or bonus rooms, Low-E coated windows reflecting signal, and lots of smart devices competing for airspace.</li>
          <li><strong>Typical Fix:</strong> One strong central AP plus a second AP or wired mesh node for distant areas, with careful channel planning on 5 GHz or 6 GHz bands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Wi-Fi Killers In Any Home</h2>
        <p>Regardless of style, some things almost always hurt Wi-Fi:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Routers hidden behind TVs, in cabinets, or next to giant metal appliances.</li>
          <li>Fish tanks, mirrors, and big metal furniture right in the signal path.</li>
          <li>Neighboring networks all stacked on the same channel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Part of every RezNet visit is hunting down these hidden signal killers and fixing what we can – by moving hardware, tuning channels, or adding a better-placed access point.
