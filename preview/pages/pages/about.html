      Who we are

    <h1 data-reveal>
      RezNet is the independent authority for home networks.
    </h1>

    <p class="lead" data-reveal>
      Most residential networks are installed. Very few are evaluated.
      We exist to make networks measurable, explainable, and fixable — starting with an assessment, not a sales pitch.

  <!-- INDUSTRY PROBLEM -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="h2" data-reveal>The industry problem</h2>
    <p class="p" data-reveal>
      Internet providers sell speed. Installers sell equipment. Retailers sell convenience.
      What rarely happens is objective measurement of the house itself.
    </p>

    <p class="p" data-reveal>
      Layout, materials, interference, wiring condition, device load, and backhaul limitations determine performance far more than advertised bandwidth.
      When networks are built around assumptions instead of evidence, homeowners are left guessing — and overbuying.
    </p>

    <p class="p" data-reveal>
      RezNet exists to end the guessing.

  <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->

    <h2 class="h2" data-reveal>Assessment first. Evidence always.</h2>

        <div class="title">Evidence over assumption</div>
        <p>
          Decisions should be based on measurable findings, not marketing claims or “try this router.”

        <div class="title">Infrastructure over hype</div>

    <div class="grid-3">
      <div class="card" data-reveal>
        <div class="title">Independent</div>
        <p>
          No ISP affiliation. No vendor quotas. No incentive to sell hardware unless it’s necessary.

      <div class="card" data-reveal>
        <div class="title">Inspection-grade reporting</div>
        <p>
          Every assessment produces a structured document: verdict, prioritized findings, and a phased roadmap.

      <div class="card" data-reveal>
        <div class="title">Implementation by request</div>

          The assessment stands on its own. If you want us to manage the work, we build to the report spec — so it’s verifiable.

  <!-- THE REZNET STANDARD -->
  <section class="section dark">
    <div class="badge" data-reveal>The RezNet Standard</div>
    <h2 class="h2" data-reveal>Certification is available — and it means something.</h2>

    <p class="p" data-reveal>
      “Certified” should not be a sticker. It should be a defensible claim based on measured conditions and documented outcomes.
      RezNet certification is awarded when a network meets defined requirements for stability, coverage, and readiness.
    </p>

    <div class="grid-3">
      <div class="card" data-reveal>
        <div class="title">What we measure</div>
        <p>
          Coverage & stability by area, interference/channel health, wired readiness, topology risk, and bottlenecks (ISP vs router vs Wi-Fi vs backhaul).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card" data-reveal>
        <div class="title">What certification means</div>
        <p>
          The network meets the standard at the time of verification, and the homeowner has documentation for decisions, resale, or future upgrades.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card" data-reveal>
        <div class="title">What it does NOT mean</div>
        <p>
          It does not guarantee an ISP’s external reliability, nor does it replace future changes in usage, layout, or new devices.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- CERTIFICATION LEVELS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 class="h2" data-reveal>Certification levels</h2>

    <div class="grid-3">
      <div class="card" data-reveal>
        <div class="title">RezNet Verified</div>
        <p>
          Baseline evaluation completed. Verdict issued. Risks identified. Roadmap provided.
          (This is what every assessment delivers.)
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card" data-reveal>
        <div class="title">RezNet Certified</div>
        <p>
          Network meets stability + coverage requirements with a clean, explainable topology.
          Certification is documented and issued after verification.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card" data-reveal>
        <div class="title">RezNet Certified+</div>
        <p>
          Certified plus higher resilience: segmentation/hardening where appropriate (guest/IoT/work), reliability-first camera/IoT posture, and future-proofing notes.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="p" data-reveal style="margin-top:12px;">
      Certification is always evidence-based. If the network doesn’t meet the standard yet, the report tells you exactly what to change and why.

  <!-- CUSTOMER EMPOWERMENT -->
  <section class="section dark">
    <div class="badge" data-reveal>Customer empowerment</div>
    <h2 class="h2" data-reveal>We believe homeowners deserve clarity.</h2>

    <p class="p" data-reveal>
      A home network is infrastructure now: work, school, security cameras, smart devices, entertainment, and communication depend on stability.
      Our role is to give you a clear verdict and an upgrade plan you can actually follow.
    </p>

    <p class="p" data-reveal>
      You should understand what works, what doesn’t, why it’s happening, and what to do next — without being pressured into random purchases.

  <!-- WHAT WE REFUSE -->

    <h2 class="h2" data-reveal>Residential networks deserve standards.</h2>

    <p class="p" data-reveal>
      Building inspections exist for structure. Energy audits exist for efficiency.
      Yet most residential networks are built without inspection-grade evaluation.
      RezNet is building that standard — and applying it to real homes, with real documentation.

      Start with an assessment. The decisions become obvious.
      Certification is available when the network meets the standard.
